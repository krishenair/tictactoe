# tictactoe
A random tic tac toe game that I made on python because I was bored

#hello, I was bored at 10PM and decided to make a python tictactoe game that is very rough and unfinished as I have minimal experience. 
#I have no idea how a repository works, so I just added "tictactoe.py" to the repository and called it a day. Downloading the file will result in 
#a tic-tac-toe game.
